# deconz_hue_smart_button
Simple Blueprint for the single button Phillips Hue Smart Button
My first project for the community. 

I couldn't find a basic blueprint for this anywhere, so I based one off of this: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/deconz-philips-friends-of-hue-smart-switch-4-buttons/258114

I'm open to add features if they are available for the button.
